## Overview

The Nutri-Score Based Nutrient Assessment and Recommendation Application empowers users to make healthier food choices by transforming complex nutritional information into an intuitive health score. The application integrates advanced barcode scanning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies to capture nutritional data from food products, retrieves detailed product information from the Open Food Facts API, and processes this data using a Nutri-Scoreâ€“like algorithm.

The result is a clear, color-coded health score along with personalized recommendations for healthier alternatives, enabling users to quickly understand and compare the nutritional quality of food products while shopping.

## Data Flow

When a user scans a product:

1. The scanning component (BarcodeCamera or OcrCamera) captures the data
2. The ViewModel processes the captured data
3. The Repository accesses local database or Open Food Facts API if needed
4. The Nutri-Score calculation is performed
5. The recommendation engine identifies healthier alternatives
6. Results are displayed to the user through the UI layer
